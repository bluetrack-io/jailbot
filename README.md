# denton-jailbot
The City of Denton Police Department publishes a list of current inmates at the city jail on a public website.

There is no historical record of this information, yet many citizens use it to get information and over time
there are questions about various stats that result from the data published there.

This project seeks to facilitate the scraping, archiving and querying of this data for information over time.
